# Megastore_Analysis

This collection of repositories connects to numerous dashboards showcasing sales, profit, and business forecast data using Tableau's Superstore dataset. Various visualization styles are illustrated, including sunburst charts, area charts, donut charts, mapping, and more.

References: The Superstore data utilized in these dashboards is sourced from and accessed on Tableau Public.

While I authored the Superstore Year to Date (YTD) Analysis dashboard, it drew significant inspiration from and incorporated similar visuals found in Data Tutorials on YouTube.
